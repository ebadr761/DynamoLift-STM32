This is a continuation of the Kinematics Engine project I made on the STM32 microcontroller. The goal is to have a fully functioning velocity-based training device that measures "explosivity" for athletes. One way of doing so is by attaching the device to a weighted barbell and performing bench press, squat or deadlifts and storing the speed of those lifts.
